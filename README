Goal
----

Reasonable input for touchscreen. Use raw touchscreen input to generate
keyboard and mouse input.


Current state
-------------

First I thought that I'm going to use X11, but finaly I've decided to use raw
/dev/input/event* instead. That will let me use raw framebuffer (GTK supports
that) and overcome very nasty and complicated X11 protocol. Especially that I
don't really need multiwindow. Except that it turned out that such an interface
give me much more information than X11. Cool. I already see that I can get
multitouch data, but I don't support it yet.

I have integrated it all with fblib (also on my github) so that I can draw on
the screen using touchscreen. Using utilities from this repo, I can also record
framebuffer state and translate it to ppm format frames an then (using ffmpeg) convert it to video.

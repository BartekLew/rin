Goal
----

Reasonable input for touchscreen. Use raw touchscreen input to generate
keyboard and mouse input.


Current state
-------------

First I thought that I'm going to use X11, but finaly I've decided to use raw
/dev/input/event* instead. That will let me use raw framebuffer (GTK supports
that) and overcome very nasty and complicated X11 protocol. Especially that I
don't really need multiwindow. Except that it turned out that such an interface
give me much more information than X11. Cool. I already see that I can get
multitouch data, but I don't support it yet.

Except that I have ability to recognize different input sources (USB Mouse,
touchpad, touchpad buttons, etc.), but probably I won't use that as I aim
at touchscreen only environment.


Output
------

I produce two binaries â€” debug (will check all assumptions, will print all
unsupported stuff) and release which print only what I'm interested in.
This is to always validate DEBUG/REALEASE code. Except that assumptions
very often happen to be wrong here so I always code them and check.
